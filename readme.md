## What are the main components of multiboard?

The main components of multiboard are: 

1. Panels. Base panels (boards) that were originally meant to be placed vertically (and secured against a wall).  They
   can also be used horizontally (e.g. under a desk, see Underware below). 

2. Accessories to attach to the wall.
  - Shelves,
  - Hooks,
  - etc.

3. Storage containers
  - these can be used stand alone or can be attach to the panels
  
## What makes multiboard panels special?

A multiboard board is composed of a grid of tiles.  Each tile is 25mm in size. See
   https://thangs.com/designer/Multiboard/3d-model/6x6%2520Multiboard%2520Core%2520Tile-974378 
   
Each tile is threaded. In between 4 tiles there is a diamond with a threaded hole in the middle.

Attachments can connect to Multiboard in four different ways: 

- tiles: 
  - push connectors (they rely on pressure and friction to stay in place)
  - threaded connectors (such as [Multiconnect](https://makerworld.com/en/collections/3718428-multiconnect-base-models)) that take advantage of the threads
  
- diamonds:
  - pass through connectors (similar to those found in pegboards)
  - threaded connectors, such as bolts.

## What is Underware?

Underware is a system created by HandsOnKatie (https://handsonkatie.com/) with the goal of managing cables and other accessories under a desk.
Underware can use multiboard panels as a substrate but it can also use OpenGrid panels.
