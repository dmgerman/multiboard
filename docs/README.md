## What is Multiboard?

[Multiboard](https://www.multiboard.io) is a modular organization system that can be 3D-printed. It is designed to help users create customizable storage and organization solutions for various applications, such as wall-mounted panels and more.

## Is Multiboard Free?

Yes, for most use cases, downloading and 3D-printing Multiboard components is free. However, you can support the project by subscribing to their [Memberships](https://www.multiboard.io/support). Memberships are optional and not required for general use.

## Main Components of Multiboard

The main components of Multiboard include:

- **[Tiles](./parts/tiles/README.md)**: Base panels that can be used vertically (e.g., mounted on walls) or horizontally (e.g., under desks). Tiles are modular, symmetrical, and stackable for efficient printing.
- **Accessories**: Attachments for tiles, such as:
  - Shelves
  - Hooks
  - Storage containers (standalone or attachable)
  - Other modular components

These components allow for endless customization and scalability, making Multiboard suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Remixing

Remixing or designing models for Multiboard is allowed but read the [License](#license) first. You can learn more and get STEP and STL files for remixing [here](https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/remixing)

### Can I create models for multiboard that are not affected by the Multiboard license?

While this is not legal advice, it appears that the simplest way is to avoid reusing official files (e.g. STEP or STL files from Multiboard.io).

There two generic methods that will allow you to create components free of Multiboard.io files:

1. Simply add holes to your design. This holes must 7.2mm diameter at least and spaced every 25 mm.
   - Use bolts compatible with Multiboard  to attach to the panel.
2. Design your model to use multiconnect (See below). Multiconnect is an open, flexible and powerful method to connect attachments to different types of boards, including the Multiboard, the [Honeycomb Storage Wallsystem](https://www.printables.com/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall), the [Greatly Over Engineered WallSystem](https://www.printables.com/model/1090032-goews-greatly-over-engineered-wall-system), and the [OpenGrid Wall/Desk mountingframework](https://www.printables.com/model/1214361-opengrid-walldesk-mounting-framework-and-ecosystem).

## License

Multiboard is licensed for personal, non-commercial use. For commercial use or selling derivatives, you must obtain a commercial license. Key points of the license include:

- **Personal Use**: You can use the 3D designs for personal projects.
- **Commercial Use**: Selling Multiboard products or derivatives requires a commercial license.
- **Remixing Designs**: You can remix designs as long as:
  - The remix is non-trivial.
  - The remix is distributed under the original Multiboard license.
  - Proper credit is given, including links to the website and license.
  - You grant a full license to the Multiboard creators for your remix.

For full details, see the [Multiboard License](https://www.multiboard.io/license).

## Compatible Systems

### Multiconnect

[Multiconnect](https://makerworld.com/en/models/790825-multiconnect-generic-connector-for-multiboard-v2#profileId-735507) is a generic connector system that can be used to attach several models to your multiboard panel. It is not specific to multiboard, but
can be used with other systems like HSW, GOEWS, Idea Skadis and openGrid as well. This makes multiconnect very versatile and allows you to use the
same accessories on different systems.

Multiconnect also provides modeling files to be used when creating your own accessories.

See:

- [Standard multiconnect](https://makerworld.com/en/models/790825-multiconnect-generic-connector-for-multiboard-v2)
- [Flush multiconnect](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1026736-flush-multiconnect-generic-multiboard-connector) (perfect match for Underware, see below)
- [Modeling files](https://makerworld.com/en/models/645768-multiconnect-v2-modeling-files)
- [Full set of multiconnect files](https://makerworld.com/en/collections/3718428-multiconnect-base-models) (also for other boards)

You may also find many [models compatible to multiconnect on makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/search/models?keyword=multiconnect) and

### Underware

[Underware](https://handsonkatie.com/) is a system designed for managing cables and accessories under desks. It is compatible with Multiboard panels and OpenGrid panels. While Underware is not part of Multiboard, it can use Multiboard tiles as a substrate for its components.
