## Features

- **Threaded Design**: Each tile is threaded, enabling the use of threaded connectors such as [Multiconnect](https://makerworld.com/en/collections/3718428-multiconnect-base-models) or bolts.
- **Diamond Connectors**: Between every four tiles, there is a diamond-shaped area with a threaded hole in the center. This allows for additional connection options, such as pass-through connectors or bolts.
- **Symmetry**: Tiles are symmetrical on both sides, making them easy to use and assemble in any orientation.
- **Stackable Printing**: Multiple tiles can be printed on top of each other to save time during manufacturing.

## Connection Methods

Tiles support four primary connection methods:

1. **Tiles**:
   - **Push Connectors**: Rely on pressure and friction to stay in place.
   - **Threaded Connectors**: Utilize the threads for secure attachment, such as [Multiconnect](https://makerworld.com/en/collections/3718428-multiconnect-base-models).

2. **Diamonds**:
   - **Pass-Through Connectors**: Similar to those found in pegboards, allowing for flexible configurations.
   - **Threaded Connectors**: Use bolts or other threaded components for a strong hold.

## Applications

- **Base Structure**: Tiles form the base where you can screw in threads, insert snaps, or use pegboard-style holes.
- **Surface and Shelving**: Tiles can act as the surface or supporting brackets for shelves.
- **Modular Assembly**: Their symmetrical design and stackable printing make them ideal for creating modular and scalable structures.

The Multiboard tiles are a versatile and essential component of the system, enabling endless possibilities for customization and functionality.

## Types

### Core Tiles

Core Tiles have two sides with pegboard holes, making them ideal for the central sections of a Multiboard wall.

### Side Tiles

Side Tiles feature one side with pegboard holes, designed for the edges of a Multiboard wall.

### Corner Tiles

Corner Tiles have no pegboard holes on any side, perfect for the corners of a Multiboard wall.

## Mounting

Tile can be attached to surfaces using the following methods

### Screws

Tiles can be attached to a surface using screws directly through the peg holes or using a screw on mount. The following screw types are reconmmend:

- 3.5mm x 20mm screw
- #8-32

### Adhesive

Command Strips or VHB/Nano tape can be use with mounts designed for adhesives. Examples of these mounts are [Single Snap (DS Part A) - Small Command Strip Mount](https://than.gs/m/1112072) and [Single Snap (DS Part A) - Medium VHB Tape Mount](https://than.gs/m/1060994)
